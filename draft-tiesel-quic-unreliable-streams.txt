             Considerations for Unreliable Streams in QUIC
              draft-tiesel-quic-unreliable-streams-latest

Abstract

   This memo outlines support for unreliable streams in QUIC.  This
   draft contains a collection of considerations and requirements for
   unreliable streams in QUIC as well as a proposal how to implement
   unreliable streams within QUIC-xx.  The intention of this document is
   to collect all unreliable streams considerations and framing till
   these can be merged in [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-transport] and [I-
   D.draft-ietf-quic-recovery].

1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", and
   "MAY" are used in this document.  It's not shouting; when these words
   are capitalized, they have a special meaning as defined in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   There are many use cases for use cases for unreliable streams,
   especially in cases where an application has to meet deadlines for
   data delivery and have to avoid head of line blocking.  But for many
   of these use cases, there is still a need to transmit some data,
   often control or meta data, reliably.

   This memo describes how QUIC can provide reliable and unreliable
   transmission within the same connection.  We advocate to allow the
   application to request reliable or unreliable transmission in QUIC on
   a per stream level.  As we do allow a QUIC implementation to
   retransmit unreliable stream frames, it is possible to implement a

   mix of reliable and unreliable transmission within the same, tagged
   unreliable, stream.

3.  Connection Level Considerations

3.1.  Unreliable Stream Support Negotiation

   To keep the complexity of a minimal QUIC implementation low, the
   support of unreliable streams is optional.  An endpoint signals its
   willingness to receiving unreliable stream frames during the TLS
   handshake using the transport parameter
   accept_unreliable_stream_frames (value TBD - used as flag the same
   way as omit_connection_id specified in [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-
   transport]).

   Connections on behalf of applications that make no use of partial
   delivery of stream data should not send
   accept_unreliable_stream_frames even if the QUIC implementation
   support it.

4.  Stream Level Considerations

4.1.  Stream Open

   In addition to the stream open specified in [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-
   transport], an endpoint opening a stream MUST indicate whether the
   stream is reliable and therefore the receiver can rely on the sender
   retransmitting lost stream data.

   We see two options how to indicate whether a stream is reliable or
   not:

   o  Leave it completely to the application layer.

   o  Indicate it in the stream frame header by repurposing the 'F'
      (FIN) bit as 'R' (RELIABLE) bit and indicate the stream close
      using CLOSE_STREAM / RST_STREAM frames.

   See Appendix A for an implementation proposal of the former and
   Appendix B for an implementation proposal of the latter.

   The authors advocate for explicitly signaling unreliable streams in
   the stream frame header as it does not introduce additional
   interwinding between QUIC and the application and makes usage of
   unreliable streams for a limited amount of stream data much easier.

4.2.  Stream Close

   As frames of unreliable streams may not be retransmitted, the loss of
   a frame indicating the end of a stream may introduce zombie streams.

4.3.  Stream ID 0x0

   Data of stream 0x0 MUST be transmitted reliably as TLS expects
   reliable transmission.

5.  Application Interface Considerations

5.1.  Retransmissions within Unreliable Streams

   While unreliable streams suggest just disabling retransmissions for
   these streams, applications my choose to apply arbitrary
   retransmission strategies for unreliable streams, e.g. retransmit
   stream data as long it will likely be delivered on-time with respect
   to an application provided deadline or only retransmit certain byte
   ranges.

   An QUIC implementation that implements retransmissions on a per-
   packet basis therefore may retransmit unreliable stream data even if
   not requested by the application.

5.2.  Presentation of Unreliable Streams

   The presentation of unreliable streams is application specific.

   The anticipated use cases include: - Data being delivered annotated
   with its offset as it is received.  - Data being delivered after a
   deadline, e.g. with an annotated list of holes and byte ranges of
   lost data filled with zeros.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

Appendix A.  Implementation proposal with application layer indicated
             relniabliliy

   This implementation proposal lets the decision and indication of
   unreliable transmission completely to the application.  In this
   proposal, the state space and error handling for applications can
   become quite complex when control messages at the start of a stream
   are transmitted unreliably.  The advantage of this implementation
   proposal requiring only minimal changes to [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-
   transport] and [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-recovery].

A.1.  Stream Close

   As frames of unreliable streams may not be retransmitted, the loss of
   a unreliable stream frame carrying a FIN bit may lead to zombie
   streams.  To prevent this this STREAM fames carrying the FIN bit MUST
   to be retransmitted if lost regardless whether a stream is reliable
   or not.

Appendix B.  Implementation proposal with stream frame indicated
             relniabliliy

   This implementation proposal repurposes the 'F' (FIN) bit from [I-
   D.draft-ietf-quic-transport] as 'R'(RELIABLE) bit and indicates the
   stream close using CLOSE_STREAM / RST_STREAM frames.

B.1.  Stream Open

   o  The sender opening an reliable stream must set 'R' bit of the type
      byte for a STREAM frame to 1.

   o  The sender opening an unreliable stream must set 'R' bit of the
      type byte for a STREAM frame to 0.

   A client that has not indicated its willingness to receive unreliable
   stream frames as using the transport parameter
   accept_unreliable_stream_frames MUST answer with a RST_STREAM frame
   indicating a STREAM_STATE_ERROR when receiving a STREAM frame having
   the 'R' bit not set.

   All frames of a stream MUST have the R bit to the same value.

B.2.  Stream Close

   Streams MUST explicitly closed with a CLOSE_STREAM frame indicating
   the stream ID and final offset of the stream to prevent zombie
   streams.  (Alternative implementation option: RST_STREAM frame with
   error code NO_ERROR indicating the final offset).  The the
   CLOSE_STREAM / RST_STREAM frame has to be resent if lost even if the
   stream frames of this stream are transmitted unreliably.

   o  Once an endpoint has completed sending all stream data, it sends a
      CLOSE_STREAM frame.  The stream state becomes "half-closed
      (local).

   o  A stream in state 'open' for which a CLOSE_STREAM frame is
      received, transitions to "half-closed (remote)" state.  An
      endpoint could continue receiving frames for the stream if not all
      data advertised in 'Final Offset' was received.

   This reduces the code paths that cause state transitions from open to
   half-closed and eases state keeping for unreliable streams by having
   reliable signaling of closing unreliable stream.  It comes with the
   caveat of increasing the minimal on-wire data of a stream by 16
   bytes.
